    <h1>The invention</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It was a hot day. In fact it was so hot you could have cooked --- on the sidewalk. Squigly sat on his front porch trying to eat his --- before it melted.
        Just as Squigly was about to go inside, he saw --- coming down the street. --- was skipping so --- that Squigly was sure --- would faint from the heat. When --- reached his front porch, Squigly noticed that --- wasn't even sweating.
        
        "How can you not be hot?" asked Squigly, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
        
        "Hot, I'm not hot, I'm wearing my invention" said ---.
        
        "What kind of invention is that?" asked Squigly.
        
        "Frozen --- of course, I heard it was going to be hot today so I just put my --- in the freezer last night and today I feel great! It really works, you should try it."</p>
